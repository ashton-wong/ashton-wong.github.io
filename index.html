                    <p>I grew up in the great state of Texas! The capital city of Austin to be exact. Did you know that the capitol 
                        of Texas was made to be about 15 feet taller than the US Capitol? (That's what the giant star that Lady
                        Libery holds is for)

                    <p>I graduated high school at the Liberal Arts and Science Academy, or LASA for short, with a magnet
                        endorsement and 4.3 GPA. I did a lot of things there, including but not limited to playing lacrosse,
                        football, golf, and starting both a computer science club and an economics club.

                <p>I'm currently a Regents Scholar at UC Santa Barbara pursuing a Computer Science B.S and 
                    Certificate in Technology Management. I'm still discovering where my passion lies in the 
                    applications of Computer Science, but I've found an interest in artificial intelligence, 
                    web and mobile development, and business. I've gained diverse experience in leadership positions, 
                    as well as core communication skills in a fast-paced work environment. 
                    Furthermore, I dedicate a lot of my time as an active member of the UCSB Men's Lacrosse Team.</p>
